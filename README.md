## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I revised how to create button objects with just anchor tags. I looked at using opacity as a nice hover effect. I used grid and auto-fit to create a nice responsive site. I continued utilising BEM in order to create a more organised code base with a view to creating something that was both more maintainable and also easier to modify.

### Continued development

My knowledge using grid is still not very stable and I still feel quite uncomfortable with it. I'm having to refer to online resources in order to get things done. I'd like to continue to strengthen this skill.
